# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, Test, and Lint Commands

- **Build**: `cargo build` (debug) or `cargo build --release` (release)
- **Test**: `cargo test` (all tests)
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Format**: `cargo fmt` (auto-format) or `cargo fmt --check` (check only)
- **Quality Checks**: `make check` (comprehensive) or `make quick` (fast checks)

For development workflow, always run `make pre-commit` before committing changes.

### Specific Test Commands
- Assembly tests: `cargo test ann_asm` (requires NASM: `apt install nasm`)
- Specific assembly test: `cargo test ann_asm -- simple_mov`
- Integration tests: `cargo test --test integration_test`
- Simulation tests: `cargo test --test simulation_test`
- Unit tests: `cargo test --bins`
- Run with verbose output: `cargo test -- --nocapture`

## Code Architecture

Fezinator is a Rust CLI tool for extracting and analyzing assembly code blocks from ELF and PE binaries, with a git-like interface.

### Core Modules
- **cli/**: Command-line interface with subcommands (extract, import, list, remove, analyze, simulate)
- **extractor/**: Binary parsing and assembly extraction using `object` crate
- **db/**: SQLite database operations with `rusqlite` for storage and deduplication
- **analyzer/**: Assembly code analysis functionality using Capstone disassembler
- **simulator/**: Assembly simulation framework with state generation, compilation, and execution
- **error.rs**: Centralized error handling with `thiserror`

### Data Flow
1. CLI parses commands and delegates to appropriate modules
2. **Extract**: Extractor parses ELF/PE binaries → extracts random assembly blocks → stores in database
3. **Import**: Imports NASM assembly files directly into database
4. **Analyze**: Retrieves extraction from database → disassembles using Capstone → analyzes live registers, memory access, exits
5. **Simulate**: Analyzes extraction → generates random initial state → creates assembly harness → compiles/links → executes (optionally with emulator) → captures final state
6. Database module handles storage with deduplication by SHA256 hash

### Database Schema
- `binaries` table: Stores binary metadata (path, size, hash, format, architecture)
- `extractions` table: Stores assembly blocks with address ranges and references to binaries

### Key Dependencies
- `object`: ELF/PE binary parsing
- `rusqlite`: SQLite database operations with bundled SQLite
- `clap`: CLI argument parsing with derive features
- `capstone`: Assembly disassembly and instruction analysis
- `rand`: Random block selection and state generation
- `tempfile`: Temporary file management for compilation
- `uuid`: Unique simulation identifiers

### Simulator Architecture
The simulator module enables execution of extracted assembly blocks:
- **AssemblyGenerator**: Creates complete assembly harnesses with state setup/capture
- **CompilationPipeline**: Compiles assembly to binary using NASM and ld
- **ExecutionHarness**: Executes binaries natively or through emulators
- **RandomStateGenerator**: Generates random register/memory states for testing
- **EmulatorConfig**: Supports FEX-Emu for cross-architecture execution

## Development Notes

- Assembly test framework requires NASM assembler (`apt install nasm`)
- Integration tests compile test binaries using GCC
- Simulation tests require NASM and ld for runtime compilation
- Pre-commit hooks available via `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`
- Quality assurance tools: cargo-audit, cargo-machete, cargo-outdated, cargo-geiger
- Run build, tests and lint every time, ensuring they are successful before finishing a feature and before committing
- In code and commits, do not mention Claude as Co-author or that code is generated by Claude
